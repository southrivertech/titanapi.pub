# TitanAPI Powershell Guide

The TitanApi powershell module is located in the Powershell Gallery [TitanApi](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/TitanApi)

# Important Information

There was a small API change for the Titan powershell momdule in version 0.1.7 where each command now has a parameter named 'AdminUrl' which you set to the machine name or IP address and port for the REST API. This was done so that the powershell module can be used on linux instances where the remote admin port must be used. This is also helpful for using the powershell module on remote Windows servers as well. The examples provided all include the new AdminUrl option which is required when using version 0.1.7 of the Titan powershell module or later. If you want to use a previous version of the powershell module simply remove the AdminUrl parameter from any command. Do not include https:// when specifying the machine name simply use it as follows '-AdminUrl localhost:31443' or '-AdminUrl 10.2.3.4:41443' If the AdminUrl parameter is not provided you will be prompted for it.

# Getting Started

1. Install or Update TitanApi by downloading it from the Powershell Gallery

    ```
    Install-Module -Name TitanApi -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```
   
2. Getting module version
    ```
    Get-installedmodule TitanApi
    ```

3. To list commands

   ```
   Get-Command -Module TitanApi
   ```

4. Get help on a command and list parameters use the Get-Help `<cmdlet name>`

   ```
   Get-Help Invoke-Login
   ```
   
5. Error handling - Each command will return response object that will consist of 2 members, "Response" which contains command specific information, and "Result" which contains any error codes if the command fails.

  ```
   $loginResponse = Invoke-Login -username admin -password mypass -AdminUrl localhost:31443
   $loginResponse.Result | Format-List
   ErrorCode    : 0
   ErrorStr     : Success
   SubErrorCode : 0
   SubErrorStr  :
  ```  
6. Updating to latest version of TitanApi module

   ```
   Update-Module TitanApi
   ```
   
# Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress and the best way to see how to do something is with the provided samples. You can get help on each command in powershell with Get-Help `<command>` you can also view online documentation [here](https://github.com/southrivertech/titanapi.pub/blob/main/sdk/powershell/docs/TitanApi.md)

# Samples

The [samples](https://github.com/southrivertech/titanapi.pub/tree/main/sdk/powershell/samples) folder contains many examples of using powershell to query and configure the server. 

# Identifying Servers / Users / Groups

Most objects on Titan Server are identified by unique guids which can be queried by listing servers/users/groups. Alternatively you can often just pass the name of the server/user/group as a replacement for the guid

# Authenticating to Server

* Login/Authenticate to the server before issuing any commands. The login response from the server will contain the session token which can be set as an environment variable so it will be added to future commands in the Authorization header for https requests.
```
    $login = Invoke-Login -UserName `<username>` -PassWord `<password>` -AdminUrl localhost:31443
    $env:SRTAuthToken = $login.Response.SessionInfo.BearerToken
```  
* Logout from server and invalidate the session

```
  Invoke-Logout -BearerToken $env:SRTAuthToken
```


# Server Related Commands

* List servers
  ```
  $serverList = Get-SvrList -AdminUrl localhost:31443
  $serverList.Response.ServerList | Format-List
    or
  (Get-SvrList -AdminUrl localhost:31443).Response.ServerList | Format-List
  ```
* 
* Get server state - Returns information about the srever like is it running, which protocols are currently running etc.
    ```
    (Get-SvrState -serverGUID myserver -AdminUrl localhost:31443).Response | Format-List
    ```
* Set server state - Modify the server state by performing an action. Valid actions are ("stop" | "start" | "restart" | "rotatelog" | "quota" | "smstest"

  ```
     Set-SvrState -ServerGUID my-server-name -Action stop -AdminUrl localhost:31443
  ```
* Create a server - Creates a new server instance. The new server params object is returned in $r.Response, with this you can then modify any specific settings you want and then save the settings.

  ```
  $newServer = new-object Titan.API.Models.SrtApiModelsApiServerCreateRequest
  $newServer.ServerName = "mynewserver"
  $newServer.General.ServerDesc = "This is my new server"

  $r = New-Svr -Body $newServer
  $r.Response | Format-List
  ```

* Delete a server

  ```
  Remove-Svr -serverGUID my-server-name
  ```
  
* Get a list of server variables useful for using in events. The level parameter can be either "user", "group", "server", or "domain"
  ```
  (Get-SvrVar -level user).Response.vars.AdditionalProperties | format-list
  ```
  
* Get Server Parameters
  ```
  $sp = Get-SvrParam -ServerGuid mynewserver
  $sp.Response | Format-List
  $sp.Response.Ftp | Format-List
  ```

* Set Server Parameters - It's generally best to only set parameters for a specific poco or section of the settings rather than the entire server params object as shown below.
  ```
  $ftp = new-object Titan.API.Models.SrtApiModelsApiServerParamsFtpPoco
  $sp.Response.Ftp.AllowPasv = 1
  $r = Set-SvrParam -serverGUID myserver -Ftp $sp.Response.Ftp
  ```

# User Related Commands

* List users - List all users for the specified auth provider native.

  $newUser.Username = "mytestuser"
  $newUser.Password = "password"
